# Security tests (M7)

All run in `bun run test` (offline) and in CI.

| Area | File | What |
|---|---|---|
| Leak regression | `apps/desktop/test/security/leak-regression.test.ts` | proxy bodies/headers/errors, IPC results/errors on every channel: no full key, access token, cookie; Bearer in free text, raw 48-char keys in JSON/text, short masks in form bodies are masked; renderer-supplied credentials never forwarded; dispatch guard blocks a handler that returns a key |
| Guards | `.../guards.test.ts` | exact CSP (no eval/inline/remote/wildcard) on every app-protocol response; navigation/window.open decisions; all permissions denied, downloads cancelled, webviews blocked; locked webPreferences (`devTools` off when packaged); IPC only from our main frame |
| Surface snapshots | `.../surface-snapshots.test.ts` | exact `window.pa` surface and IPC channels; proxy allow/deny lists, masked-save paths; key-taking relay endpoints unreachable |
| Input validation | `.../input-validation.test.ts` | path traversal fuzz (app protocol, proxy, harness fs incl. symlinks), masked admin saves refused, server URL validation |
| Bundle scan | `scripts/scan-bundle.mjs` + `.../scan-bundle.test.ts` | built bundles: no secret shapes (private keys, sk- keys, GitHub/Slack/AWS tokens, Bearer literals, unprefixed 48-char new-api keys assigned to a key-like name with mixed case + digit — hashes/single-case IDs never match; plus any bare 48-char high-entropy string without keyword context, same heuristic as sanitize, suppressible only via `scripts/scan-bundle-allowlist.json` = sha256 + justification, findings print sha256 not the string) in .js/.json/.map/.html/.txt/.svg under `dist/` and `release/`, including files inside `.asar` archives (in-memory parser); main/preload (own code, not node_modules): no weakened webPreferences, `openDevTools`, remote module, raw `ipcRenderer` exposure. Prints file/rule/offset only |
| CI policy | `.../ci-policy.test.ts` | workflow stays read-only, SHA-pinned, secret-free, publish-free |
| Renderer DOM | `src-local/__tests__/security-dom.test.tsx` (local pages run) | after key actions the DOM holds no key/token/cookie, no link carries a key, renderer never fetches a key |
| Copy-curl | `apps/desktop/test/keys.test.ts` | origin chosen by main, key charset + quoting (Aegis M5 MUST 1/2) |
| Packaging | `apps/desktop/test/window-policy.test.ts`, `test/packaging/*` | packaged menus/devTools, reproducible source tarball, placeholder build check |

Changing CSP, the preload surface or the allowlist requires updating the snapshot test and this file in the same commit.
